# bage-11
AEK 11u Gummy O-Ring mount case. This case is based off of the Bage 60 case.

This is for 3D printing only. For CNC, a couple of features including the holes on the case might need to be tweaked.

# PCB
This is designed to be used with [Syndrome PCB](https://littlecraftery.com/products/syndrome-pcb) from LittleCraftery. The pcbs are also stocked by [RNDKDB](https://rndkbd.com/products/extra-plates-and-syndrome-pcbs-for-detour-40). PCB supports a variety of layouts including ALPS and MX. The PCB mount tabs need to be broken off before using.


# Plate
Plate provides one possible layout that is supported as ALPS only on the Syndrome PCB. You can use the file to make plates for alternate layouts.

# Build
The complete build needs the following
- Case, Syndrome PCB, Plate
- UDB C3 or equivalent with a JST cable
- [O-Ring - 250](https://www.mcmaster.com/1173N489)
